## Beyond Work or Study

I also enjoy playing games, and you're welcome to join me on Steam! You can find the link to my profile at the footer of this website. My all-time favorite game is Minecraft, as you might have noticed from the Creeper logo on my site :material-minecraft:. If you'd like to play together, feel free to reach out to me via email.
